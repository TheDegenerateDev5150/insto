"""On-demand provider reads: one bounded, fail-fast request budget, no writes.

These two operations are the only desktop capabilities that ask the provider
about an account the user just typed, and they are deliberately the narrowest
possible network surface:

- **Nothing local is touched.** The profile's `config.toml` is read for the
  token; no database is opened, no `cli_history` row is written, no snapshot is
  saved and nothing is created under `output/`. A lookup therefore runs happily
  beside a watch daemon owned by the same profile: neither takes a lock.
- **A ceiling on paid requests, not only on time.** `lookup.profile` buys 2
  requests (4 if both are retried once); `lookup.activity` buys at most
  `MAX_PAGE_REQUESTS` pages however long the provider's cursor goes on, and
  answers with what it already paid for rather than spending past the cap.
- **One budget, fail fast.** 60 seconds covers the whole request including the
  client close, the worker is cancelled at the deadline exactly as credential
  validation cancels its own, and the retry ladder is replaced by a single
  quick retry of a transient failure. A rate limit is reported immediately
  rather than slept on: the CLI's five-attempt ladder can block for minutes,
  which a window waiting on one click cannot afford.
- **Bounded output.** Every string and every list below is capped, so a hostile
  or merely verbose account cannot approach the 2 MiB response limit.
